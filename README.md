# appfollow-frontend-test
I have added cors package to the server due to the issues with cors and deployed it to the heroku. Here it's the [link](https://github.com/VladSez/appfollow-server) to the server repo and [link](https://appfollow-server.herokuapp.com/) to the server URL.
You can test an application [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/VladSez/appfollow-frontend-test)
